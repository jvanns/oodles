--[ Building

First, copy .config-example to .config and modify it according to your
development platform. For Linux and OSX 10.5 this should be pretty
straight-forward. You must have Boost >= 1.42 installed as the .config
may suggest...

* mkdir -p bin/{test,prog}
* make -j2 all

All test programs will be under bin/test. Test input data is under test/input.
